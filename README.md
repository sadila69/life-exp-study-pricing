# Life Insurance Experience Study & Pricing

This project explores a simplified actuarial workflow using synthetic life insurance data:

- Data ingestion
- Experience study
- Pricing and reserves
- Sensitivity analysis

## Mortality Experience Study

Below is the Actual/Expected (A/E) mortality ratio by attained age from our synthetic life insurance dataset:

![Mortality A/E by Age](reports/figs/ae_by_age_v2.png)


_Interpretation_: An A/E near 1.0 suggests mortality experience aligns with expected. Ratios >1.0 indicate higher actual deaths than expected, while <1.0 suggests lower mortality.
